1. Is the game too easy or hard? Give 2 unique reasons why it is easy or hard?

The game was pretty difficult to play. The Player character eventually runs out of frame and makes it
difficult to see the obstacles. The powerups sometimes are too close to the obstacles, which makes those
powerups almost useless if they'd be counteracted with an obstacle.

2.What 2 changes would you do to make it easier or harder?

The changes I would make to the game easier would to space out the obstacles and powerups more so
they aren't merged together in some instances and to keep the Player character in frame by moving the camera
to a better angle if it's going to be in a fixed position, so it would be easier to detect obstacles and powerups.


3. List 2 things that would give it a "wow" factor.

Sound effects and background music would give the game more of a "wow" factor, because it will help improve the immersion of the game.
Another thing that would give it a "wow" factor would be to create more hazzards, such as lava tiles or even pit tiles where the Player character
could fall through and restart from a spawn point.

4. What 2 parts of the game are fun? 

The running animation while controlling the character is fun because it makes the game much more immersive. Another part of the game 
that is fun is avoiding obstacles and running towards power ups because it either gives an advantage or a disadvantage to getting to
the finish line.

5. What 2 parts of the game are tedious?

Not being able to back up is a tedious feature, because the Player character continuously runs straight at a constant speed (unless hitting powerups/obstacles)
which makes it difficult to avoid obstacles. Another tedious part of the game is not having the character in frame during the end portion of the game, it makes
it difficult to avoid obstacles when it happens.
